knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, highlight = TRUE)
```

## Overview

```{r custom_class, echo = FALSE}
question_is_correct.always_correct <- function(question, value, ...) {
  return('correct')
}

ques <- question(
  "Custom Method",
  answer("answer", correct = TRUE),
  type = c("always_correct", "learnr_text")
)
ques
```


If you'd like users to submit open-ended answers, use a text box question.  Correct and incorrect answers will be matched exactly (including white space). A minimum of one correct answer is required.

Text value inputs are trimmed before they are compared to answers provided.
