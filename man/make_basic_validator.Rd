\title{A simple validity function for use with local storage}
\usage{
make_basic_validator(psfile = NULL, instructor_secret = NULL)
}
\description{
This simple validity function is adequate for basic authoring and testing needs.
It reads login credentials from a file that can be read without authentication.
Storage is "local," meaning that the store is a CSV file typically in the same directory
as the tutorial .Rmd file. This can work on a shiny server that has persistent file storage
(which means, not shinyapps.io), or on the author's desktop.  It can also work on
individual user machines, but each user/machine will have its own, independent storage.
