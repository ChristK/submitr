\title{Create a recorder function for learnr}
\usage{
make_a_recorder(store_fun, submitr_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{store_fun}{A call to one of the constructors for a
storage mode. Possibilities:
- `record_local(filename)`
- `record_gs4(key, email, vfun)` where `key` is the identifier
for the particular Google Sheet to be used in account `email`. The `vfun` function

\item{submitr_id}{The user ID as authenticated during login.}
}
\description{
This function is used internally and is not intended for authors (or users)
of tutorials. Recorder functions are  called automatically by `{learnr}` in
response  to an event. There is a standard set of arguments for
any recorder function. The function constructs another function which
will be the one actually used by `{learnr}`.
